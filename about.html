        <p class="float-left" style="width:60%"> I started drinking matcha in 2021 as a typical coffee addict. I noticed immediatley how the caffeine effect was completley different, and that day I made the switch and never looked back. Regular coffee made me feel anxious and caused me to crash in the middle of the day. This didn't help my relationships, work ethic, or mental health. After adapting matcha into my morning routine, it started other healthy habits in my life. The energy it gave me kept me awake all day and eliminated my nap schedule (which was very healthy for me). Eventually I influenced other people in my life to make the switch, and I watched as it benefited their life like it did mine. Now I want to encourage other people to make the switch. </p>
